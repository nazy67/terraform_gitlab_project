### terraform_gitlab_project
terraform template which provisions an EC2 instance with security group in default VPC with User Data. User Data will install git lab inside of the EC2 while it's bootstraping. 
Before I wrote a terraform template I created manually step by step the process, using CentOS 7.6 droplet on Digital Ocean platform. After that all gets created on aws cloud platform.

##Project is still in process...
